# üêæ Animal Detection and Driver Alert System using YOLOv5

A university-level AI project that implements a real-time animal detection system using **YOLOv5s** to assist drivers by providing alerts when animals or pedestrians appear in dangerous proximity on rural or wildlife-prone roads.

---

## üìå Project Overview

This system aims to reduce vehicle-animal collisions by detecting animals and estimating their distance from the camera in a video stream. The model is based on **YOLOv5s**, which outperforms traditional methods like HOG + Cascade Classifier as discussed in the IEEE paper:

> _"A Practical Animal Detection and Collision Avoidance System Using Computer Vision Technique"_

## üöÄ How It Works

This animal detection and warning assistant system works through the following pipeline:

1. **Load Pretrained Model (YOLOv5s):**  
   The pretrained `yolov5s.pt` model is loaded using `torch.hub` from the official [Ultralytics YOLOv5 repo](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5).

2. **Open Input Video:**  
   The input video is read frame-by-frame using OpenCV‚Äôs `cv2.VideoCapture()`.

3. **Resize Each Frame:**  
   Each frame is resized to a fixed resolution of **1280x720** to standardize input and improve distance estimation.

4. **Run YOLOv5 Detection:**  
   Each frame is passed to the YOLOv5 model which returns:
   - **Bounding boxes**
   - **Class labels**
   - **Confidence scores**

5. **Filter Detected Classes:**  
   Only animal-related and human-related classes (like `person`, `dog`, `cow`, `horse`, etc.) are kept for further processing.

6. **Estimate Distance:**  
   An approximate distance to each animal is calculated based on:
   - The size of the bounding box
   - Known average width of real animals
   - Basic camera perspective math (simplified for demonstration)

7. **Draw Danger Zone:**  
   A red "danger region" is drawn in the lower area of the frame ‚Äî if an animal is detected within this zone and is close enough, a warning is triggered.

8. **Trigger Warnings and Braking Simulation:**  
   - If distance < threshold ‚Üí `ALERT` is shown on screen  
   - Simulated braking command is activated (can be extended to real braking systems in advanced vehicles)

9. **Save the Output Video:**  
   The final processed video with annotations is saved using OpenCV‚Äôs `cv2.VideoWriter()` for review or demo purposes.
